AzureADAdminRolesReportMSGraphV2.ps1 - Uploaded Azure AD admin role assignment audit script written for the assocaited Microsoft Graph Modules.  It uses a "Sort" function to clear duplicate lines at the
moment so it's technically on a bandaid fix until either Graph gets better documentation or I figure something else out on my own.

AzureADAdminRolesReportMSGraphV2.ps1 - Built-in a C:\Temp check and module Install/Import checks for the script and added comments to add documentation for how the script works.

AzureADAdminRolesReportMSGraphV2.ps1 - Added the -Scopes parameter to the "Connect-MgGraph" line to specify the read-only scopes the user needs to connect to graph with for this
script to actually function.
